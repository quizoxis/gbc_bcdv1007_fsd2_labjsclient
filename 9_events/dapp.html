<h2>Decentralized Application (DApp)</h2>
<p>
    An open source, trustless software application with the backend code running on a
    decentralized peer-to-peer network rather than a centralized server.

    on the network. An address is a string of alphanumeric characters, but can
    also be represented as a scannable QR code.
